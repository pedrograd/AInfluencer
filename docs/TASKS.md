# TASKS - Master Backlog

**Purpose:** Master task backlog. Never delete tasks; only change status. Every task must have a Task ID.

**Format:**
- Backlog (TODO) - Tasks not yet started
- In Progress (DOING) - Currently being worked on
- Done (DONE) - Completed with evidence

**Task ID Format:** T-YYYYMMDD-### (e.g., T-20250115-001)

**Traceability Rules (MANDATORY):**
- Every task MUST have: Task ID, Status (TODO/DOING/DONE), Source(s)
- Source format: `Source: <file path>:<section or line-range>` (e.g., `Source: docs/01_ROADMAP.md:24` or `Source: docs/00_STATE.md:154-170`)
- DONE tasks MUST include:
  - **Evidence:** List of changed files (e.g., `Evidence: backend/app/api/errors.py (new), backend/app/api/router.py (updated)`)
  - **Tests:** Commands run + results (e.g., `Tests: npm run lint passed (0 errors), type/lint verified`)
  - **Notes:** Brief description of what was implemented
- DONE tasks cannot exist without Evidence + Tests recorded
- Never invent tasks; only extract from explicit text in docs (checkboxes, TODO, MUST/SHALL requirements)

**Compliance Rules:**
- Tasks flagged as "BLOCKED (Compliance Review)" relate to stealth, anti-detection evasion, fingerprint spoofing, proxy rotation to bypass platform enforcement, or ToS-bypassing automation
- These tasks are kept as high-level notes only and should NOT be expanded into detailed implementation steps without compliance review
- All tasks must include a "Source: <file>:<line or heading>" reference

## Notes

- Tasks are extracted from `docs/00_STATE.md` NEXT_3_TASKS and `docs/07_WORKLOG.md`
- Priority follows AUTO_POLICY: Foundation first (launcher + logging + dashboard), then UX accelerators, then expansions
- Evidence format: `<file paths>` | Tests: `<command + result>` | Notes: `<short description>`
- Anti-loss rule: Tasks may grow to 100+; never delete. If a task is split, create new Task IDs and link them ("Split from T-...").
- Anti-conflict rule: Only ONE chat/session may edit files at a time; other chats must be read-only.
